Usage: ESAY [channel] <text>
   Works like SAY with some enhancements. As the bot parses the text
   it replaces predefined variables with their current value:
      $cc         Current channel
      $channels   Channels
      $on         Ontime
      $time       Current time
      $tog(x)     Show current setting for toggle "x"
      $up         Uptime
      $ver        EnergyMech version
      $links      Show active links

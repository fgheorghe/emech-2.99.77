telnet
verify over botnet

/*
 *  EnergyMech TODO (March 9th, 2001)
 */

 - Intra and Inter-process userfile sharing and synchronization

 - Genuine telnet protocol support for telnet sessions (?)

 - Built in nslookup and finger (?)

 - SOCKS4/5 support (?)

 - Undernet CService support (IMHO, should be channel settings (set=password, tog=enable/disable) /proton)

 - DalNet Nickserv/Chanserv support (needed? they dont tolerate much bots on that network /proton)

 - Update/complete the help files.

 - Mode +/-o commands to check for SO and if SO is set, check userlevel and make sure user has access before sending MODEs.

 - Multiple channels per userrecord.

 - Make it possible to pipe SPY through another bot.
   Ex: bots = laurel, hardy; /msg laurel -spy #emech hardy!#emech

 - Mode +v a user who verifies if channel is set to +m
   (too clever?)

 - Recognize some common forms of channel spamming (eg, `join #blablabla')
   (can be done with kicksays?)

 - botnet logic so that all linked bots dont end up on the same server(s)
   prevent losing channels cuz they were all on the same one -- the rebooted one..

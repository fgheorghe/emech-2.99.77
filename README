NOTE: This bot is not maintained. I uploaded it here for those nostalgic folks that want to use
version 2 instead of 3.

Compiling?
~~~~~~~~~~
To compile the source:

1) Uncompress the source code distribution archive.

2) cd emech-2.99
-- Since you are reading this file, you have most likely already come to this point.

3) ./configure
-- This script will prompt you for features to include or exclude,
   going with the default isnt a bad idea.

4) make clean install

If all went well you should now have an executable called ``mech''.

Setup?
~~~~~~

... this needs new documenting for E3 ...

Updated Files?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The main distro-site for the Starglider Class is:

   http://www.energymech.net/index.html

You can also find the files on ftp at:

More Help?
~~~~~~~~~~

Read the  website for  goodness sake!  Thats what  its there  for!

		  #emech is not a help channel

If you HAVE to ask  a question in #emech  then make damn sure that
its not covered by the website  documentation and try to ask it in
a way so that  we dont have  to type half  a book just to tell you
the answer.

Do NOT ask to be guided in #emech.  We will under no circumstances
help you compile, configure or run a bot.

We absolutely hate people who come into the channel asking utterly
simple  questions like  `Why doesnt  my bot connect',  `Whats  the
command to add a user', etc.  If you manage to stay in the channel
after asking something like that its simply because we're too damn
lazy to kickban your ass.

We will NOT teach  you how to work with UNIX  shells or how to use
your mech, you have to learn that by yourself. Im noting this here
since it seems to be a common misconception that we would.

In short:

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED AS IS. YOU ARE ENTIRELY ON YOUR OWN WHEN
IT COMES TO CONFIGURING AND USING IT.
